autogencomments: true

# regex matches for filenames that you want to include or exclude from
# the samplr generation. Be careful to indent using spaces.
# For a file to be sampled, it has to meet both requirements: be included and not excluded.
excludes:
  - \.sample # It's a good idea to exclude all *.sample* files, otherwise it will behave recursively
  - \.go$ # Most of the times, the code files won't need samples
  - ^vendor # Dependencies shouldn't be sampled
  - ^node-modules # Dependencies shouldn't be sampled
includes:
  - ^config # Matches files like ./config/setup.yml or ./configuration/script.sh 
  - \.yml$ # Matches all .yml files in the project
  - Dockerfile # Matches all Dockerfile in the project
